# Lab 25 - Shopping

### Instructions

The items available in a grocery store, and their prices, are stored in the text file `store_db.txt`.  You will be reading that file into a dictionary so you have easy access to the data.  You will then read the shopping list stored in `shopping_list_1.txt`, add the items listed into the shopping cart, and print the contents of the cart and the total value of the cart.  More detailed instructions are in `main.py`.

You may create additional shopping lists to help you test your code.

There are no tests for this lab.
